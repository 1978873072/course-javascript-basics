There is no universal way of debugging client-side JavaScript. The only way to debug client-side JavaScript is through the browser.

Server-side JS can be debugged in several ways:
  - VS Code has integrated debugging
  - NodeJS comes with V8 inspector
  - [Debugging with V8 inspector](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.olulnv55w)

Fortunately all browsers have their own debugging tool/plugin that makes it easier:
  - Firefox has **Firebug**
  - Chrome and Opera have **Web developer**
  - Internet Explorer has **F12**
