>>What are some tools you can use to share your code? <<

( ) VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text {{Incorrect because these are text editors, not applications used to share your code with others.}}
( ) Node Monitor {{Incorrect because node monitor is used for executing your JavaScript code, not for sharing your code with others.}}
( ) ESLint {{Incorrect because ESLint is used to help you code easier and is not a tool for sharing your code with others.}}
(x) Github (Open Source), Pastebin {{Correct, because Github and Pastebin are two ways of sharing your code online with others.}}
( ) There are no such tools {{Incorrect because using sites such as Github will allow you to share your code with others.}}

||Sharing your code with others can be accomplished by making your code open source. ||
