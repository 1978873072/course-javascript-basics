JavaScript is a front-end scripting language developed by Netscape for dynamic content. JavaScript is:
  - lightweight, but with limited capabilities
  - can be used as object-oriented language
  - embedded in your HTML page
  - interpreted by the Web browser
  
JavaScript's client-side, mobile and desktop technology is simple and flexible. It can access and edit all the elements of an HTML document using the HTML DOM.
