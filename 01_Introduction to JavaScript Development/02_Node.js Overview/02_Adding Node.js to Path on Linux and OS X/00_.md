Installing Node.js to your Mac/Linux:

Node.js probably already exists on your Mac/Linux. If not, go to the Node.js site and download it there. If you have an older version of Node.js, also go to the website to download the latest stable release. If you cannot find the Node.js even after installing it, check your bash profile and make sure Node.js exists as a PATH variable.
