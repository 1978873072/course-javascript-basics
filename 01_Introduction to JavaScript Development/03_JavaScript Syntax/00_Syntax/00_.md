If you've ever learned C-Sharp, JavaScript syntax shouldn't be a problem for you. Otherwise, the list below gives you a rough idea of the syntax used in JavaScript.

Syntax used for:

  - Operators (`+`, `*`, `=`, `!=`, `&&`, `++`, â€¦)
  - Variables (`var myVariable = 5`)
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
  - Loops (`for`, `while`)
  - Arrays (`my_array[]`) and associative arrays (`my_array['abc']`)
  - Functions (`function myFunction{}`)
    - can return value

We will explore these concepts in-depth as we progress through the course.
