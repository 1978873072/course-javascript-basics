As mentioned previously, JavaScript can also be debugged locally with Node.js. Node.js has it's own debugger that can be called using the `inspect` keyword. Here's how you will debug a JavaScript file:

1. Open Terminal/CMD
2. Navigate to the folder of the file to debug
3. Run 
```
node inspect filename.js
```
4. You will then see the debugging screen. This is what you will be using later. Type control c twice and exit the debugger.
5. Go back to your JavaScript file and add the statement `debugger;` to create a breakpoint
6. Run step 3 again and a breakpoint will occur
