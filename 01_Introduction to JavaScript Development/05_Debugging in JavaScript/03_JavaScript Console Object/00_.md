If you are editing JavaScript locally or through node.js, you can also use the `console` object. As shown in previous examples, `console.log` prints something to the console when called. If you are familiar with Java, it's just like debugging with the `System.out.print()` statement.

You can use this function to write log messages at runtime to identify where the error in the program occurs. Below are some methods of the console object:

  - `debug(message)`
  - `info(message)`
  - `log(message)`
  - `warn(message)`
  - `error(message)`
