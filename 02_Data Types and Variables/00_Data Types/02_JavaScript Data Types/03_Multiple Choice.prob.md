>>Which of the following statements assigns the integer 2 to the variable `varOne` ? (Assume `varOne` has already been declared)<<

( ) `varOne == 2` {{Incorrect because assigning a value to a variable only requires one equals sign.}}
(x) `varOne = 2` {{Correct because assigning a value to a variable requires one equals sign and the value itself.}}
( ) `let varOne = 2` {{Incorrect because this is a variable declaration. The question assumes that the variable declaration has been made.}}
( ) `varOne is 2` {{Incorrect because assigning a value to a variable does not use the word "is".}}
( ) `varOne += 2` {{Incorrect because this statement adds 2 to the value of `varOne`.}}
