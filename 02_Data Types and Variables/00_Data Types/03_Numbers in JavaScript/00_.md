All numbers in JavaScript are stored internally as double-precision floating-point numbers, following the IEEE-754 Standard. Integers are accurate up to 15 digits while decimals are accurate up to 17 digits. 

Extremely large or small numbers such as 10^9 or 10^-9 can be written using scientific notation if necessary. Numbers can be wrapped as objects of type `Number`, which essentially does the same thing and creates a number according to the data type.
