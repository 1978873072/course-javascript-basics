String represents a **sequence of characters**:
- Strings are enclosed in quotes:
  - **Both `'` and `"` work correctly**
  - **ES6** also includes <code>`</code> (ticks) for string interpolation
- Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator

Strings are stored as Unicode:
  - Unicode supports all commonly used alphabets in the world
    - E.g. Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, etc. scripts
