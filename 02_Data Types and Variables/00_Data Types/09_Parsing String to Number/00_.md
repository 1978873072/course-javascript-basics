As mentioned before, strings can be parsed to numbers. We already explored how to use `string | 0` to convert a string into an integer. However, the methods `parseInt` and `parseFloat` can also to be used to convert strings into either floating-point numbers or an integer. `parseInt` and `parseFloat` exhibit a strange behavior you should keep in mind. If a non-number string starts with a number, only the number is extracted from the string when the method is called. An example of this is shown below with `str_1` and `str_2`.
