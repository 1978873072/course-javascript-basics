A variable is a placeholder of information that can usually be changed at run-time. As mentioned previously, it is a piece of computer memory holding some value. Variables allow you to store information, retrieve the stored information, and manipulate it whenever you please. These variables are the fundamental blocks of your program and should be used as often as possible instead of just using plain numbers and strings.
