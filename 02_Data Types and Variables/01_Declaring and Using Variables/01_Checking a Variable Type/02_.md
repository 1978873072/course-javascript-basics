As you can assume from the first example of the `typeof`, it returns "number" for any numbers, "string" for any strings, and "object" for any objects. If a data type is called using an object like the second example above, the data type of the variable will be an object. The last two cases are special cases that you probably won't encounter as often as the others. The value "null", which is given to an object that hasn't been assigned to any value, is actually classified as an object according to JavaScript. On the other hand, variables that are assigned "undefined" have a data type "undefined", which you will probably never use while coding. Keep the two special cases in mind as you move on and make sure you understand how the `typeof` operator works.
