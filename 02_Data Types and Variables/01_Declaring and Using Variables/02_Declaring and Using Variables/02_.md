As we explained in the paragraph above, variables don't have to be initialized when they are declared. In the sample program above, `emptyVariable` is only declared but not initialized, thus printing "undefined" when it is printed to the console. The other three variables are called using `var`, `let`, and `const`, the three different methods used when declaring a variable.
