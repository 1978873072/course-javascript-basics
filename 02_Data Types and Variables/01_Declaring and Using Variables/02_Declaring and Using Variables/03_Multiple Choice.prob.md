>>Consider the following code segment:

```
let varOne;
console.log(varOne);
```

What does the code above print to the console?<<

( ) "Undef" {{Incorrect because "undefined" will be printed on the console, not an abbreviation of the word "undefined".}}
(x) "undefined" {{Correct because the data type of the variable is undefined as the variable is declared but not initialized.}}
( ) The code segment above will print nothing on the console {{Incorrect because the `console.log()` statement above will print "undefined" to the console.}}
( ) The code segment above will cause an error {{Incorrect because the `console.log()` statement above will print "undefined" to the console.}}
( ) "varOne" {{Incorrect because the `console.log()` statement above will print "undefined" to the console.}}

||The code segment above does not cause an error and will print something to the console. ||
