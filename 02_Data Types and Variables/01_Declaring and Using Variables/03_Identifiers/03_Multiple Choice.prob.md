>>Which of the following variable declarations consist of a good JavaScript identifier?<<

(x) `let sum = 0;` {{Correct because "sum" clearly describes what the variable is used for.}}
( ) `let x = 1;` {{Incorrect because "x" does not describe the variable in detail.}}
( ) `let abc = 20;` {{Incorrect because "abc" does not describe the variable in detail.}}
( ) `let SUM = 0;` {{Incorrect because "sum" shouldn't be capitalized unless it is a constant.}}
( ) `let 1-10Sum = 0;` {{Incorrect because identifiers cannot start with a digit.}}

||A good identifier is descriptive and concise. ||
