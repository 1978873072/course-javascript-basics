Assigning values to variables is achieved by the `=` operator. The `=` operator has a variable identifier on the left and a value on the right (of any value type). Assigning is done from right to left, so a statement like `var sum = 5 + 3;` will assign 8 to the variable `sum`. As mentioned previously, variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
