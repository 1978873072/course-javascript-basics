As shown in the sample program above, there are many different methods you can use to assign values to variables. The first example with `firstValue` is the most common method where you directly assign a value to the variable. A variable can be used as a value when initializing a different variable, as shown with `secondValue`. The `thirdValue` is assigned by chaining `firstValue` and the number 3, which is one way of assigning the same values to different variables. However, this method is not recommended as it may create unwanted errors in your program.
