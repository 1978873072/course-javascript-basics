( ) `varTwo = varOne = 5;` {{Incorrect because the statement assigns both `varOne` and `varTwo` to the value 5.}}
(x) `varTwo = varOne;` {{Correct because the statement clearly assigns the value of `varOne` to `varTwo` using an equals sign.}}
( ) `varTwo == varOne;` {{Incorrect because only one equals signs should be used when assigning values to variables.}}
( ) `varOne = 5;` {{Incorrect because the statement assigns `varOne` to the value 5.}}
