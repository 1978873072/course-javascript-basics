Assigning values to variables is achieved by the `=` operator.

The `=` operator has:
  - Variable identifier on the left
  - Value on the right
    - Can be of any value type
  - Could be used in a cascade calling, where assigning is done from right to left

Variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
