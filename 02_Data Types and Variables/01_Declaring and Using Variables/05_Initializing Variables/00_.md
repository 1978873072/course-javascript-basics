Initialization is the assignment of initial value to a variable. Initialization must be done before the variable is used. Otherwise, the variable will hold a value of "undefined" or "null", which is not desired. As shown in previous examples, there are several ways of initializing a variable. You can either initialize a variable using a literal expression or by referring to an already initialized variable.
