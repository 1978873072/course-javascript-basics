Variables are either local or global. Local variables are declared with the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const` while global variables are usually declared without any keywords. The keywords `var`, `let`, or `const` are not exactly the same, as shown below:
  - `var` - the variable lives in the scope of the current function or in the global scope
  - `let` - the variables lives in the current scope
  - `const` - like `let`, but cannot be reassigned
