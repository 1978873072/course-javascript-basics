The sample program above consists of two variables, `a` and `b`. Variable `a` is a global variable while `b` is a local variable. This is the reason why `a` can be printed anywhere in the program while `b` can only be printed inside the function `print()`. Since we haven't touched on functions yet, ignore the function statement and look for the difference between `a` and `b`. Since `b` is called inside the function, it can only be used within the function. It does not "exist" anywhere else in the program. If you haven't tried this already, try removing the comments for `console.log(b)` and run the program to see what happens when you try to access a local variable outside of its scope.
