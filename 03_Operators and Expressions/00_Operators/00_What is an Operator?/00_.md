An operator is a symbol that represents an **operation performed over data** at runtime:
  - Takes **one or more arguments** (operands)
  - Produces a **new value**

**Operators have precedence** (priority):
  - Precedence defines which will be evaluated first
  - Parenthesis operator always has highest precedence
    - **It's considered a good practice to use parentheses, even when it's not necessary** to improve code readability
    - When in doubt, take a look at the [MDN Precedence chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

Operators in JavaScript:
  - **Unary** – take one operand
  - **Binary** – take two operands
  - **Ternary** (`?:`) – takes three operands

Except for the assignment operators, all binary operators are left-associative. The assignment operators and the conditional operator (`?:`) are right-associative.

Operators by categories in JavaScript:

- Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`)
- Logical (`&&`, <code>&#124;&#124;</code>, `^`, `!`)
- Binary (`&`, <code>&#124;</code>, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`)
- Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, `!==`)
- Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, <code>&#124;=</code>, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`)
- Concatenation (`+`)
- Other (`.`, `[]`, `()`, `?:`, `new`, `in`, `typeof`, `instanceof`, `...`)
