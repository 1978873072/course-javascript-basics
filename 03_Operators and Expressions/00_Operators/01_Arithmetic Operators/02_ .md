The sample code above show a variety of variables as well as arithmetic operators and how they function. Incrementing and decrementing a variable (`b++`) is actually the same as doing `b = b + 1`, but with less effort. As explained above, dividing any number by zero will result in positive or negative infinity based on the sign of the first operand. Zero divided by zero will return NaN, which stands for "Not a number". Using the remainder operator with a negative number and a positive number will result in the a negative value for the remainder, as shown with `console.log(-11%3)`.
