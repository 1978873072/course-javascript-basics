Logical operators take boolean operands and return boolean result.

Operator `!` turns `true` to `false` and `false` to `true`. 

Behavior of the operators `&&`, `||` and `^` (`1` == `true`, `0` == `false`). 

`true`-like and `false`-like values:
- JavaScript, as a weakly typed language, can turn every value into `true` or `false`
- Every value can be converted to it's boolean representation using double not - `!!`
