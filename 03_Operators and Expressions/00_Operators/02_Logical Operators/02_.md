As shown in the sample code above, logical operators are extremely useful and crucial for almost any program. Logical operators can even be used together as shown in the fourth `console.log()` statement above. True-like or false-like values represent other data types that are converted to true or false using `!!`. Knowing which data types result in true or false is not as important as knowing how to use the logical operators, so focus on mastering logical operators before diving into true-like and false-like values.
