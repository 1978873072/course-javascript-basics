>>Which of the following statements evaluate to true?<<

[x] `10 < 20 && !false` {{ selected: Correct because both `10 < 20` and `!false` are true.}, { unselected: Correct because both `10 < 20` and `!false` are true.}}
[x] `10 == 20 / 2 || false` {{ selected: Correct because `10 == 20 / 2` is true.}, { unselected: Correct because `10 == 20 / 2` is true.}}
[ ] `20 < 10 && !false` {{ selected: Incorrect because `20 < 10` is false.}, { unselected: Incorrect because `20 < 10` is false.}}
[x] `30 == 10 || 27 == 3 * 3 * 3` {{ selected: Correct because `27 == 3 * 3 * 3` is true.}, { unselected: Correct because `27 == 3 * 3 * 3` is true.}}
[ ] `10 == 20 || 20 < 10` {{ selected: Incorrect because both `10 == 20` and `20 < 10` are false.}, { unselected: Incorrect because both `10 == 20` and `20 < 10` are false.}}

||The logical AND Operator evaluates to true if both expressions are true, while the logical OR operator evaluates to true if any of the expressions evaluate to true. ||
