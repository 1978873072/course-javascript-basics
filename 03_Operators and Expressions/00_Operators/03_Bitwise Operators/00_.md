Bitwise operators are used on integer numbers. The operators are applied bit by bit. For example, the binary format for a 16-bit integer 300 is "00000001 00101100". This is how the computer stores using only 0s and 1s. There are a few operators that can be used with numbers. The chances of using this operator is pretty low, so don't worry too much about mastering this concept as long as you have a good idea of what's happening. The operator `~` turns all `0` to `1` and all `1` to `0`. This is similar to the logical not operator (`!`) for boolean expressions but bit by bit. The "or" (`|`) and the "and" (`&`) behave like `&&` and `||` but works bit by bit. The left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators shift (move) the bits to the left or to the right.
