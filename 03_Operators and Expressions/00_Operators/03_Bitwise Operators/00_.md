Bitwise operators are used on integer numbers. They are applied bit by bit.

Operator `~` turns all `0` to `1` and all `1` to `0`
  - Like `!` for boolean expressions but bit by bit

The operators `|`, `&` behave like `||`, `&&` for boolean expressions but bit by bit.

The `<<` and `>>` shift (move) the bits to the left or to the right.
