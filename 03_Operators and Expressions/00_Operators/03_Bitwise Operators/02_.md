The bitwise operators are pretty confusing, so let's clear things up and see how each bitwise operator affected the bits. The first operator (`|`), looked through each bit of the numbers 3 and 5, and combined them to create one number. This operator changes all the combines the vertically aligned bits with one rule: "Anything with a 1 is converted to a 1". It's exactly what the `||` operator does, where true is 1 and false is 0. The `&` operator converts everything to 0 unless two 1s are present. The `~` operator as explained above simply changed all the 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. The left shift and right shift operators shift the bits to the left or to the right by one as shown in the comments above.
