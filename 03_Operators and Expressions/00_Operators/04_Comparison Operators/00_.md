Comparison operators are used to compare two variables. These variables can be numbers, strings, booleans depending on the operator used. The comparison operators return true or false based on the operands used. Comparison operators are mostly used expressions to determine equality or difference between two operands. Below is a list of all the comparison operators:

`==`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`,`===`,`!==`

For equality comparison, the use of `===` and `!==` is preferred. `===` checks if the two operands are of equal value and of equal type, while `==` just checks if they are of equal value.
