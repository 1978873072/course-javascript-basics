A few comparison operators are shown above with comments on how they function. The toughest concept is the difference between `==` and `===`. As stated in the paragraph above, the `===` operator checks if two operands have the same value AND are of the same data type, while the `==` operator checks if two operands hold the same value. This is why `c == d` prints true even though `c` is a number while `d` is an object. Therefore, `c === d` will print false even though they both hold the value 2.
