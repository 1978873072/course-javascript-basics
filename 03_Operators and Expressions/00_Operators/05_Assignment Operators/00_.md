Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. There for many different types of assignment operators, but the good ones to know are listed below.

`=`,`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

As you can see above, most of the assignment operators are just other operators with an extra equals sign. In fact, the assignment operators can be broken down to individual operators:

`a+=b` is the same as `a = a + b`
`a-=b` is the same as `a = a - b`
`a*=b` is the same as `a = a * b`
`a/=b` is the same as `a = a / b`
