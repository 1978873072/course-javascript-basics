The statements inside the `console.log()` statement change the value of x before printing it on the console. As explained in the paragraph above, `x -= 1` is essentially `x = x - 1`, which is why the second print statement prints 5. The rest of the assignment operators work the same way. These assignment operators are good to know and extremely useful when writing programs that require quick calculations and efficient code. You can research and use other assignment operators such as `%=` after you master the ones above.
