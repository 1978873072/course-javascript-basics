>>Consider the following code segment:

```
let varOne = 20;
varOne += 5;
varOne = 35;
varOne /= 5;
```

What is the value of `varOne` after the statements above are executed?<<

( ) 4 {{Incorrect because the value of `varOne` is 7 as 35 / 5 = 7.}}
( ) 5 {{Incorrect because the value of `varOne` is 7 as 35 / 5 = 7.}}
( ) 6 {{Incorrect because the value of `varOne` is 7 as 35 / 5 = 7.}}
(x) 7 {{Correct because the value of `varOne` is 7.}}
( ) 35 {{Incorrect because the last statement in the code above divides the value of the `varOne` by 5.}}

||The value of `varOne` is assigned to the integer 35 in the third statement. ||
