Let's go through the different operators shown in the sample code above one by one. The string concatenation prints "FirstSecond15" instead of "FirstSecond6" because the "1" and the "5" are automatically converted to a string, which is why the addition did not work. The member access operator shows how the `pi` field in the `Math` object can be accessed using the dot notation. The square brackets are used with a data type called the array, which you will learn in the future. The statement `names[0]` will always print the first element of the array `names`. The parenthesis show how operator precedence is overruled using the parenthesis, just like how it would be in a regular mathematical expression. The conditional operator will print one of the statements based on whether or not "a > b" is true. Try changing the values of `a` and `b` and see if you can print the other statement. The `new` operator creates a new Number object with the value 4. Finally, the `typeof` operator prints the data type of the given value. In this case, it will print "number".
