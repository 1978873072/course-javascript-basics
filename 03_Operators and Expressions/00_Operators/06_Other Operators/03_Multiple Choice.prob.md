>>Consider the following code segment:

```
var fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
console.log(fibonacci[0]);
```

What does the `console.log()` statement above print?<<

(x) 1 {{Correct because the element with an index of 0 in the array `fibonacci` is the number "1".}}
( ) 2 {{Incorrect because the statement `arraynames[0]` will always print the first element of the array.}}
( ) 3 {{Incorrect because the statement `arraynames[0]` will always print the first element of the array.}}
( ) 5 {{Incorrect because the statement `arraynames[0]` will always print the first element of the array.}}
( ) 8 {{Incorrect because the statement `arraynames[0]` will always print the first element of the array.}}

||The number inside the square brackets represent the index of the array. The index of the first element in the array is 0. ||
