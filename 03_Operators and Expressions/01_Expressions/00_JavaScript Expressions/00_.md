Expressions are a sequences of operators, literals and variables that are evaluated to some value. Expressions have a type (integer, boolean, string) as well as a value. We've touched on this before when discussing operators and how boolean expressions can be evaluated using arithmetic/logical operators. An expression can be a statement as simple as `5 > 2` which evaluates to true.
