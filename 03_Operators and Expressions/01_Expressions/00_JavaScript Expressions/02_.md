The code above show three different arithmetic expressions. The first one is evaluated like this: (150 - 20) / 2 + 5 = 130 / 2 + 5 = 65 + 5 = 70. The other two are mathematical equations that calculate the area and perimeter of a circle given the radius. Expressions are used in almost any program to calculate numbers or boolean values when needed.
