>>Complete the function <code>rectangles</code> so that it satisfies the following condition:
<p>Calculates rectangleâ€™s area and perimeter with the given width and height. Print the area, a space, and then the perimeter in the console. <br/>
For example:<br/>
<code>rectangles(2,5)</code> should print "10 14"<br/>
<code>rectangles(3,10)</code> should print "30 26"<br/>
<code>rectangles(1,1)</code> should print "1 4"</p><<
