Operators and Expressions
=========================

### Problem 1. Odd or Even
*	Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.

### Problem 2. Divisible by 7 and 5
*	Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by `7` and `5` in the same time.

### Problem 3. Rectangle area
*	Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area by given width and height.

### Problem 4. Third digit
*	Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is 7.
*	Example: 1732 => true.

### Problem 5. Third bit
*	Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit 3 (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.

### Problem 6. Point in circle
*	Write an expression that checks if given point `P(x,  y)` is within a circle `K(O, 5)`.

### Problem 7. Is prime 
*	Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime.
*	Example: `37` is prime.

### Problem 8. Trapezoid area
*	Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides `a` and `b` and height `h`.

### Problem 9. point in circle and outside rectangle
*	Write an expression that checks for given point `P(x, y)` if it is within the circle `K( (1,1), 3)` and out of the rectangle `R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2)`.
