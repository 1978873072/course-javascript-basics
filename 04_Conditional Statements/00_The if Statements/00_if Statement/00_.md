The `if` statement is the most simple conditional statement. It enables you to test for a certain conditions and branch to different segments of code depending on the result. The `if` statement consists of two major components, the condition as well as the statements. The condition can be a boolean variable, a logical expression, a comparison expression, or anything that results in either true of false. The statement(s) are the code enclosed in the braces that run when the branch is selected.

The `if` statement is pretty straightforward. The condition is evaluated, and if the result is true, the statements are executed. If the result is false, the statements are not executed.
