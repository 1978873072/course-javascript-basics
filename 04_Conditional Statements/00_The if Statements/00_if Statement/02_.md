As shown above, the expression `numberTwo > numberOne` results in false because 24 is not larger than 123. This is why the statement `biggerNumber = numberTwo` is not executed. Instead, `biggerNumber = numberOne` is executed because the expression `numberOne > numberTwo` is true. As a result, 123 is printed, which is what we expect given the context of the message in `console.log()`. Try playing with the if statements and print the smaller number instead.
