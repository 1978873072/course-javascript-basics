As shown in the code above, instead of having two `if` statements like we previously had, we have an `if-else` statement that does the exact same thing. If the expression/condition `numberTwo > numberOne` evaluates to true, the statement `biggerNumber = numberTwo` is executed. Everything inside the `else` will be ignored. If the expression evaluates to false, the statement `biggerNumber = numberOne` will be executed, and the statements inside the `if` will be ignored. Therefore, you will never execute both statements, only one or the other.
