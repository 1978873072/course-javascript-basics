We are going to introduce two new concepts. Let's start with the `else if` statement. Since the `if-else` statement only supports two blocks, you might have thought about how you were going to approach issues will multiple possible outcomes. This is where the `else if` statements comes into play. The `else if` statement can be used as many times as you like to increase the possible outcomes.

The other concept is nesting `if` statements. The `if` and `if-else` statements can be nested, meaning they can be used inside another `if` or `else` statement. Every `else` statement corresponds to its closest preceding `if` statement. Always use the curly braces to avoid ambiguity and to make your code more readable. Avoid using more than three levels of nested `if` statements, and put the case you normally expect before the more rare cases.
