The sample code above is a simple program that prints out the number on the dice depending on the value of the variable. As you can see, there are many `if` statements and `else-if` statements so that all the possibilities are considered. Nested `if` statements are used when the dice number is divisible by two. The final `console.log()` statement under the `else` statement will print if and only if the value of `diceNumber` is not between 1 and 6. Try playing around with the value of `diceNumber` to print different messages.
