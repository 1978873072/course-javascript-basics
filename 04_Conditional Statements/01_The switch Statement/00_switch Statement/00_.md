The switch statement can make several comparisons at once. It selects for execution a statement from a list depending on the value of the `switch` expression.

How it works:

- The expression is evaluated.
- When one of the constants specified in a case label is equal to the expression:
  - The statement that corresponds to that case is executed
- If no case is equal to the expression:
  - If there is default case, it is executed
  - Otherwise the control is transferred to the end point of the switch statement
