The `switch` statement can make several comparisons at once. It's functions the exact same way as using multiple `if`, `if-else`, and `else` statements. If you have many possible outcomes and want to shorten your code or make it more readable, using the `switch` statement is recommended. It selects the statements executed based on the value of the `switch` expression and the case.

The first thing a `switch` statement does is it evaluates the expression. This expression can be of any data type, including numbers, objects, strings, etc. When one of the constants specified in a case label is equal to the expression, the statement that corresponds to that case is executed. If none of the cases are equal to the expression, the default case is executed if it exists. Otherwise, nothing is executed.
