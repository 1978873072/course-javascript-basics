The example above prints the days of the week based on the value of the variable `day`. Each case label has a number from 1-7 that prints the corresponding day. The default case is only executed if and only if the value of `day` is not between 1 and 7. The `break;` statement exists in each case for a good reason, and will be explored in the next card. For the time being, try to visualize how the `switch` statement works and how it can be used in more complex programs such as a calculator or a game.
