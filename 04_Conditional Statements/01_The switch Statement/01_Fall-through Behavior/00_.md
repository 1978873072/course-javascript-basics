JavaScript supports the fall-through behavior in `switch`. If a `case` statement does not have a `break;`, the code for the next cases are also executed until a `break;` is found. This is why the `break;` statement is crucial when using the `switch` statement. If the `break;` statement does not exist, all the cases after the "correct" case are executed until the last case, including the default case. This defeats the purpose of the `switch` statement as the statement is used when you have multiple outcomes and only want to pinpoint one outcome, not all of them. 

The function of the `break;` statement is to "break" out of the `switch` statement and continue running the code below it. The `break;` statement automatically exits the `switch` statement after it is called, which is why the statements under one case are executed instead of executing all the statements. The code below shows an example of the `switch` statement from the previous card without the `break;` statement. Run the program and check out the statements printed in the console.
