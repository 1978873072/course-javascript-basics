The sample code above prints all the log messages from "Wednesday" to the one inside the default case because the `break;` statements do not exist. As mentioned above, if the `break;` statements are missing, all the statements below the "correct" case are executed no matter what happens. The `switch` statement will always exhibit this behavior, so make sure you use the `break;` statement if necessary to avoid unwanted errors. Try adding the `break;` statements above and see what happens.
