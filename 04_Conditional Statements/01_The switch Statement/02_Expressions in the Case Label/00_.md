The expression in the case label can be anything, a number, a boolean, a string, etc. It is extremely useful when you need to check the value of the variable against many different possibilities. However, if you only have 1-3 cases, it might be better for you to just use an `if-else` statement to simplify the process. The cases are evaluated from top to bottom, and the `break;` statement exits the `switch` statement when it is called.
