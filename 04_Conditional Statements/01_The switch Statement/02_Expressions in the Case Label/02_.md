The example above uses "true" instead of a value of a variable in the expression. Therefore, the expressions inside the case label that evaluate to true are executed when the `switch` statement is executed. In this case, since the expression `twenties > 21 && twenties < 24` evaluates to true, the statements under the case are executed before the `break;` statement is called. Play around with the value of the variable `age` and print different statements to the console.
