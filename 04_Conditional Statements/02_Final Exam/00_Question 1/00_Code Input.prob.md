>>Complete the function <code>exchangeGreater</code> so that it satisfies the following condition:
<p>Write an if statement that takes two double variables a and b and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second. As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space.<br/>
For example:<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(2,30)</code> should return "2 30"<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(3,3)</code> should return "3 3"<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(5,4)</code> should return "4 5"</p><<

||Exchange their values ONLY if the first number is larger than the second number ||
