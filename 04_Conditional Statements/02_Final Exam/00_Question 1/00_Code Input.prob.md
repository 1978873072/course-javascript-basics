>>Complete the function <code>exchangeGreater</code> so that it satisfies the following condition:
<p>Write an if statement that takes two integers a and b and prints the value b first if a is greater than the b. If a is less than or equal to the b, print the value of a first. Print the first number and the second number with a space.<br/>
For example:<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(2,30)</code> should return "2 30"<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(3,3)</code> should return "3 3"<br/>
<code>exchangeGreater(5,4)</code> should return "4 5"</p><<

||Exchange their values ONLY if the first number is larger than the second number. Use nested if statements or if-else statements to solve this question. ||
