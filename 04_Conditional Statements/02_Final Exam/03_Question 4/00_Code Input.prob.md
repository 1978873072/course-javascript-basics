>>Complete the function <code>quadraticEquation</code> so that it satisfies the following condition:
<p>Reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots). Print the smaller value first with a comma in between the first root and second root.<br/>
For example:<br/>
<code>quadraticEquation(4,5,-6)</code> should print "-2,0.75"<br/>
<code>quadraticEquation(4,-49,0)</code> should print "0,12.25"<br/>
<code>quadraticEquation(2,11,12)</code> should print "-4,-1.5"</p><<
