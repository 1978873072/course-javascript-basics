The `while` loop is the simplest and most frequently used loop. It consists of a loop condition that determines the number of times the `while` loop executes a block of statements. The loop condition is usually an expression that evaluates to true or false. However, if you recall our previous discussion of true-like and false-like values, the expression could technically be of any data type. Non-zero numbers such 3 or 5 are evaluated as true while 0 is evaluated as false. Other data types also have similar cases whereas the value itself can be expressed as a true or false value.
