The `while` loop:

- The simplest and most frequently used loop
- Has **repeat conditions** (also called **loop condition**)
- Is not necessary strictly a `Boolean` value
- Is evaluated to `true` or `false`
  - `5`, `'non-empty'`, `{}`, etc.. are evaluated as true
  - `0`, `''`, `null`, `undefined` are evaluated as false
