The while loop above prints the numbers from 1 to 10 in order to the console. Let's take a look at how this works. The loop condition is the expression inside the brackets, in this case, `counter < 11`. As long as the expression is true, the statements inside the `while` loop will be repeatedly executed. The value of `counter` starts as 1, and continues to increase by one after the `while` loop is executed. 

After the first run of the `while` loop, the value of `counter` is 2 and the `while` loop will keep running until `counter` is 11. This is because "11 < 11" is false, which is why the `while` loop will stop running. If the statement `counter+=1` does not exist, the value of `counter` will always be 1, causing the `while` loop to run infinitely, causing an infinite loop.
