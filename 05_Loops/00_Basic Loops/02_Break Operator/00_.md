We've briefly touched on the function of the `break;` operator previously with the `switch` statement, so let's quickly review how it works and how it affects loops. Just like the `switch` statement, loops can be exited using the `break;` statement. Note that `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements are not affected by the `break;` statement. The `break;` statement will exit the whole loop when it is called, disregarding the loop expression or the statements that come after it.
