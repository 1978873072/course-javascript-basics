The `break;` statement is used inside the `while` loop to stop the entire loop if the value of `counter` is equal to 5. This is why the `while` loop stops printing the digits after 5 is printed on the console. As mentioned above, the `if` statement is not affected by the `break;` statement, which is why the entire loop is exited instead of the `if` statement. The `break;` statement can also be used with any of the other loops you will be learning later in the course and could potentially benefit you in the future by reducing the run-time of your code. For example, if you want to use a `while` loop to find a certain value, you would want to exit the loop once it is found instead of executing all the possible cases.
