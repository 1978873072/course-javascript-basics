The `do-while` loop is extremely similar to the `while` loop but with one difference. No matter what the condition evaluates to, it will always run the block of code once. In short, the `do-while` loop executes the block of statements before checking if the condition is true, and the repeats the block of statements until the condition is false. The `do-while` loop is used when you want to run a loop at least once no matter what the expression is.
