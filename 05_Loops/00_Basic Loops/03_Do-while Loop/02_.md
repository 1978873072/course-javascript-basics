The `do-while` loop above has the exact same function as the `while` loop we worked with in the previous card. It prints the numbers 1 through 10 in order. If you change the initial value of `counter` to 11, the loop will still run once and print 11 even though the condition `counter < 11` is false. The `do-while` is only used in special cases where you know the condition could possibly be false before even running the `while` loop, thus executing the code block before testing the condition.
