The `for` loop loops through a block of statements for a specific number of times depending on the loop expression. A typical `for` loop syntax consists of an initialization statement, a test expression (evaluated to true or false), an update statement as well a code block. The syntax for a `for` loop looks like this:

```js
for (initialization; test; update) {
    statements;
}
```

The initialization expression is executed only once, just before the loop is entered as if it was outside the loop. It is usually used to declare a counter variable that will be used in the `for` loop. The test expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the test expression evaluates to true, the statements inside the loop body is executed. If the test expression evaluates to false, the loop exited. The update expression is executed after each iteration of the loop is completed to update the counter value.
