The typical `for` loop syntax consists of:
  1. **Initialization statement**
  1. **Test expression that is evaluated to boolean**
  1. **Update statement**
  1. **Loop body block**

```js
for (initialization; test; update) {
    statements;
}
```

The Initialization Expression:
- Executed once, just before the loop is entered,like it is out of the loop, before it is called.
- Usually used to declare a counter variable:
  - Multiple variables can be declared in the initialization statement

The Test Expression:
- Evaluated before each iteration of the loop
  - If evaluated **true**, the loop body is executed
  - If evaluated **false**, the loop ends
- Used as a **loop condition**

The Update Expression:
- Executed at each iteration **after** the body of the loop is finished.
- Usually used to update the counter:
  - `for` loops support multiple update statements, separated by the `,` (comma) operator
