The `for` loop shown above is a simple loop that prints the numbers 1 through 10. The initialization statement `counter = 1` creates a local variable `counter` that controls the number of times the `for` loop executes the code block. The test expression `counter < 11` is the boolean expression that determines whether or not the `for` loop is run or exited. The update expression `counter++` is crucial as it increases the value of `counter` by 1 each time the loop is executed. If the update expression did not exist, the `for` loop would be an infinite loop that keeps printing 1. In most cases, using a `for` loop and a `while` loop doesn't make a difference, so you can select the one you are more comfortable with using.
