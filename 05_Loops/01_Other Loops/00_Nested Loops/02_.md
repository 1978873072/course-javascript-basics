The sample code above runs the outer loop and the inner loop four times each. The program prints the numbers 1-3 4 different times. The inner loop prints the individual digits while the outer loop determines how many times this task is repeated. Try changing `counter < 4` to `counter < 1`. The numbers 1 through 3 should only be printed once if this change is made. This is because the outer loop is only executed once. If the `break;` statement existed in the inner loop, it will only exit the inner loop, not the outer loop.
