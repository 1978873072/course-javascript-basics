Although the concept of arrays have not been covered in the course, you might be able to deduce what the `for-in` loop is doing in the code above. The array basically stores the numbers 1 through 6 as an element of the array. The variable `index` is a local variable that is created with the `for-in` loop and is used to access the elements of the array. Be sure to revisit this loop after learning about arrays and objects and see if you can utilize this loop in the future.
