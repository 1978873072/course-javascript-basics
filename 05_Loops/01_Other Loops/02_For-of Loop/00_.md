The `for-of` loop is similar to the `for-in` loop, but can only be used for arrays. The `for-of` loop iterates over the elements in an array and is a rather new loop in JavaScript. However, the `for-of` loop is part of the ECMAScript 6 standard and is supported by all modern browsers. Again, it is a rather advanced loop that might not be necessary or suited for you. The `for` loop can achieve the exact same results as the `for-of` loop if used correctly.
