The syntax for the `for-of` loop is very similar to the `for-in` loop as shown above. The only difference is that instead of `var index in arr`, it's `var index of arr`. Since the `for-of` loop can only be used for an array, the use case of this loop is limited, meaning you might never have to use it in the future. However, it is a great loop that can simplify the code as the `for-of` loop is much cleaner than the `for` loop. Then again, there is no difference between using a `for-of` loop and a `for` loop or a `while` loop, so it is up to you to decide what's best for you. Be sure to revisit this loop after learning more about arrays.
