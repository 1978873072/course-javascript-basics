An array is a sequence of elements. The order of the elements are fixed in an array. However, the size of the array is not fixed, meaning you can add or remove elements from it in your code. The length of the array is obtained using `arrayName.length`, which is a field in the `Array` object. As you go through this chapter, you will learn more about arrays and the different methods associated with arrays.
