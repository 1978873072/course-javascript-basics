The easiest way to declare an array in JavaScript is to list out its elements. The syntax looks like this:

`var variableName = [value1, value2, value3];`

Initializing an array can be done separately without declaring each value. There are three ways to initialize an array:

  -`new Array(elements)`
  -`new Array(initialLength)`
  -`array literal` (the method shown above)

The values inside the array can be of any data type, and mixing 2 or more data types into one array will not throw an error. You can also create an array inside an array, which is called a matrix or a 2D array. 2D arrays are pretty complex but are essential when working with objects that are two dimensional (e.g. pixels).
