We recommend two methods for declaring and initializing the array. You should either directly list all the values of an array or declare it without putting any values into the array. You can use `for` loops later in the code to place values inside the elements. The use of the `Array` object is unnecessary and not recommended when you create arrays. Mixing data types could also be tricky as you don't know which elements hold what value, so sticking to a common data type per array is also something you should consider. 

A matrix or a 2D array is something you might want to invest some time into as they will probably crucial in the future when you write more complex programs.
