>>Which of the following is a valid array declaration?<<

(x) `var arr = new Array(5);` {{Correct because this statement adheres to JavaScript syntax.}}
( ) `var arr = New Array(10);` {{Incorrect because "New" should not be capitalized.}}
( ) `var arr = new array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);` {{Incorrect because "array" should be capitalized.}}
( ) `var arr = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);` {{Incorrect because the keyword `new` is missing.}}
( ) `var arr = {3, new Date(), "Welcome"};` {{Incorrect because square brackets should be used instead of curly brackets.}}
