Array elements are accessed using the indexer operator `[]` (square brackets). The array indexer takes the elementâ€™s index as parameter in the range from 0 to `array.length-1`. The first element has an index of 0. This is true for arrays, strings, and any other objects that has an index. The last element therefore has an index of `array.length-1`. Array elements can be retrieved and changed by the `[]` (indexer) operator.
