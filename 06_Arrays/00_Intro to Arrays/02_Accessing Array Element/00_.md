Array elements are accessed using the **indexer operator**: `[]` (square brackets)
  - Array indexer takes elementâ€™s index as parameter in the range `[0; length-1]`
  - The first element has index `0`
  - The last element has index `length-1`

Array elements can be retrieved and changed by the `[]` (indexer) operator.
