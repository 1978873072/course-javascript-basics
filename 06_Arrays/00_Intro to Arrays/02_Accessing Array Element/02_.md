Counting in an array is different from counting normally. Always remember to count from 0 when working with the index of an object. The `.length` is a property of the `Array` object that is access using the dot notation. This will print the current length of the array, even if it changes as the program runs. The indexer is used in the code above to access different elements of the array and to print them to the console.
