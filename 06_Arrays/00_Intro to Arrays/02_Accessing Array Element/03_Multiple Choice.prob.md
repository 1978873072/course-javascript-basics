>>Consider the following code segment:

```
var arr = new Array(3);
arr[0] = 1;
arr[1] = 2;
arr[2] = 3;
console.log(arr[0] + "" + arr[1] + "" + arr[2]);
```

What will the following code segment print to the console?<<

( ) 23 {{Incorrect because three elements are printed to the console.}}
( ) 6 {{Incorrect because 6 is the sum of all the elements in the array.}}
( ) 12 {{Incorrect because three elements are printed to the console.}}
( ) 13 {{Incorrect because three elements are printed to the console.}}
(x) 123 {{Correct because each element of the array is printed to the console.}}

||The elements in the array are not summed as integers.||
