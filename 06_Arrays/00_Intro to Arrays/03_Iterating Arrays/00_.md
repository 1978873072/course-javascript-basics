Iterating Arrays with a `for` loop:
- Use `for` loop to process an array when you need to keep track of the index
- In the loop body use the element at the loop index (`array[index]`):

Iterating Arrays using `for-in`:

- Used when the indexes are unknown:
  - All elements are accessed one by one
  - Order is not guaranteed
  - Works for objects as well
