The first example above iterates through the array using a `for` loop. This is probably the method you would want to use in the future if you're not uneasy and hesitant about using the `for-in` or `for-of` loops. The `for` loop reads each element of the array and adds it to the variable `sum`, thus printing the sum of the array. The `for-in` loop reads each element of the array and prints the values one by one, starting from index 0.
