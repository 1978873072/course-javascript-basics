>>Consider the following code segment:

```js
var arr = [17, 34, 21, 42, 15, 69, 48, 25, 39];
for (i = 1; i < arr.length; i = i + 3){
    arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 3;
}
```

What numbers will the array contain after the `for` loop is executed?<<

( ) 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41 {{Incorrect because the 2nd index of the array should not be altered at all.}}
(x) 17, 20, 21, 42, 45, 69, 48, 51, 39 {{Correct because only the even numbers in the array are added to `varOne`.}}
( ) 17, 37, 21, 42, 18, 69, 48, 28, 39 {{Incorrect because the `for` loop doesn't add 3 to the target elements.}}
( ) 20, 23, 21, 42, 45, 69, 51, 54, 39 {{Incorrect because the 6th index of the array should not be altered at all.}}
( ) 20, 34, 21, 45, 15, 69, 51, 25, 39 {{Incorrect because the 6th index of the array should not be altered at all.}}

||The `for` loop only targets the first, fourth, and seventh index of the array.||
