All arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning their size can be changed at runtime. New elements can be inserted to the array, and elements can be removed from the array as well if needed. The two methods we're going to introduce for inserting a value into an array is the `push()` method and the `unshift()` method. The function and syntax of the methods are shown below.

`arrayname.push(element)`
 - Inserts a new element at the tail of the array

`arrayname.unshift(element)`
  - Inserts a new element at the head of the array
