All arrays in JavaScript are **dynamic**
  - Their size can be changed at runtime
  - New elements can be inserted to the array
  - Elements can be removed from the array

`arrayname.push(element)`
 - **Inserts** a new element at the **tail** of the array

`arrayname.unshift(element)`
  - **Inserts** a new element at the **head** of the array
