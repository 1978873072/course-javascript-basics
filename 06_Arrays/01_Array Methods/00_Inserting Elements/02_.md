The `push()` and `unshift()` both add an element to the original array. As mentioned above, the `push()` method adds the element to the end of the array. This is why version 1 of the array is [2,3,4,5]. The `unshift()` method on the other hand adds the element to the start of the array. Therefore, version 2 of the array ends up being [1,2,3,4,5]. These two method are two separate methods and should be used only when it is appropriate. You will probably end up using the `push()` method more often, but don't use these two methods interchangeably.
