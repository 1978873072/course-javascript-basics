As mentioned previously, all arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning elements can be removed from the array. The methods `pop()` and `shift()` are two methods that remove elements from an array. Take a look at how the method functions and the syntax below.

`arrayname.pop()`
  - Removes the element at the tail
  - Returns the removed element

`arrayname.shift()`
  - Removes the element at the head
  - Returns the remove element
