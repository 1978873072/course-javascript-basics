The `pop()` and `shift()` methods are methods that don't need to be called with a specific parameter. The `pop()` method removes the last element while the `shift()` method removes the first element of the array. Calling the `pop()` method removed the last element 5, which is why version 1 of the array is [1,2,3,4]. Calling the `shift()` method then removed the first element of the array, which is why version 2 of the array is [2,3,4]. These two methods are not the same, and are to be used when appropriate.
