Concatenating Arrays is another useful array method that can be used for many different purposes. The syntax of the method looks like this: `arr1.concat(arr2)`. The `concat()` methods inserts the element of `arr2` (the array inside the brackets) to the end of `arr 1` (the first array). This method returns a new array as a result of adding the two arrays. The two arrays used in the concatenation remain unchanged after the method is called.
