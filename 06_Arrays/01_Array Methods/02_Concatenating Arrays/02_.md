As shown above, the arrays `arr 1` and `arr 2` are concatenated to produce `arr 3`. The resulting array `arr 3` has both the elements of the first array as well as the second array. This method will prove to be useful when you want to split a big array into different smaller arrays for specific calculations before making them a big array again. The `arrayname.concat()` method is similar to the `concat()` method used when adding two strings together.
