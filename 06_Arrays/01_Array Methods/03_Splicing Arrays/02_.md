The different `splice()` methods above show how the `splice()` method can be used to achieve a wide range of actions in the array. The first `splice()` method removes 2 elements starting from index 0 and adds the elements "one" and "two" at index 0. This is why the end result is ["one", "two", 3, 4, 5]. The second `splice()` methods removes no elements from the array and adds "Jill", "Jim", and "Jacob" to the array at index 0. Therefore, the new array is [Jill, Jim, Jacob, John, Jack]. The last `splice()` method removes 2 elements from the array starting at index 0. This is why "Jill" and "Jim" are removed from the array.
