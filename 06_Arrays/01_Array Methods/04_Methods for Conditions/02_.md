The `every()` and `some()` method above checks each element against `isEvenNumber()` and returns true or false depending on the number of elements that met the criteria. This is why the first `every()` method returns false while the second one returns true. This is because odd numbers exits in `arr 1`, meaning more than one element will return false after executing the function `isEvenNumber()`. The `some()` method will return true if some of the elements meet the criteria while the `every()` method requires every element to meet the criteria.
