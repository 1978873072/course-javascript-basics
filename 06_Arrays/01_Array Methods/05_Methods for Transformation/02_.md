Let's start by looking at the `filter()` method and the new array printed by calling the method. By including the function `isEvenNumber` when calling the `filter()` method, only the elements that are even were copied to the new array that was printed. All the odd elements were filtered out of the original array. Next, the `reduce()` method was used to calculate the sum of the elements in the array. The function is placed directly inside the `reduce()` method and is used to add all the element of the array. The initial value of the variable `sum` is 0, which is why the 0 exists in the `reduce()` method as a second parameter. Finally, the `map()` function returns a new array of all the elements squared. The function is also directly inside the method in this case and is used to create a new array of the same length.
