If the use of `for` loops or the `for-of` and `for-in` loops still confuse you, don't worry, the `forEach()` method also help us iterate through an array. The `forEach()` methods loops through the elements one by one and executes the statements inside the method block until all the elements have been passed. The syntax and function of the `forEach()` method is shown below.

`arrayname.forEach(function)`
  - runs the function for each element of the array
  - iterates the elements and passes each element as argument to the function
