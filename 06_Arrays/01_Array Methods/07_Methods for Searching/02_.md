Let's take a look at the methods one at a time. The `indexOf()` method prints the first index of the digit 2 after index 0. This is why 1 is printed to the console. The `lastIndexOf()` method prints the last available index of the digit 2, which is 9, the last index of `arr 1`. The `find()` method finds the first even number in the array and prints the element to the console. The `findIndex()` methods finds the first even number in the array and prints the index of that element. This is why the index 1 is printed on the console. Take some time to digest these methods and understand how they work.
