Let's go through these methods one by one. The first method, `reverse()` reverses the array. This is why the array now starts with 10 instead 1. The next method, `join()` creates a new string where each element is separated by the colon and two spaces. The slice method prints a new array consisting of the elements between index 0 and index 4. The `sort()` method has its own function that sorts the array in ascending order, which is why the array changed from [10,9,8,...] to [1,2,3...]. The last method, `fill()`, creates a new array with a length of 10, and fills the whole array with the character 'a'.
