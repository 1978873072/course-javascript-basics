What is Chaining?
- Chaining is a pattern for calling/invoking methods in functional programming
  - Each method returns an object
    - Another method can be called on this object
    - Etcâ€¦
- To implement chaining, follow the simple pattern:
  - If a method needs to return result -> Ok, return it
    - Else return an object to enable chaining

Chaining Array Methods:
- Most of the array methods return a result so they can be chained
