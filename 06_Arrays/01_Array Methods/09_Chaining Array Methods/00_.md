Chaining is a pattern for calling/invoking methods in functional programming. Each method in the chain returns an object that is then used with another method and so on. Chaining methods is essentially calling methods one after another in one statement. As most of the array methods return an array, the methods can be chained and used consecutively to make your code more concise.
