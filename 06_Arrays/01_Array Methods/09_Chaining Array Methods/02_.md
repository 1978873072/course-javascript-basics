The `console.log()` statement above shows an example of chaining array methods by calling the `map()` method right after calling the `filter()` method. As mentioned in the comments above, the `filter()` method returns a new array [2,4,6,8,10]. This array is then passed to the `map()` method, where each element is squared. The `map()` method also returns an array, which is then printed on the console.
