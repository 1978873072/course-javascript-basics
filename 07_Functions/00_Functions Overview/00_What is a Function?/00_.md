A **function** is a kind of building block that solves a small problem.
  - A piece of code that has a name and can be called from other code
  - Can **take parameters** and **return a value**
  - Allows programmers to construct large programs from simple pieces.

Why Use Functions?
- More **manageable** programming
  - **Split large** problems into **small pieces**
  - **Better organization** of the program
  - Improve code **readability** and **understandability**
  - Enhance **abstraction**

- Avoiding repeating code
  - Improve code **maintainability**

- Code **reusability**
  - Using existing functions several times
