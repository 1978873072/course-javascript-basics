Each function has a name that is used to call the function. The name usually describes the purpose of the function and what it does. Functions in JavaScript do not explicitly define return type, so the `return;` statement is not necessary. Functions can be defined in three ways:

  - using the constructor of the Function object
  - by function declaration
  - by function expression
