Each function has a **name**
  - It is used to call the function
  - Describes its purpose

Functions in JavaScript do not explicitly define return type
  - Each function always returns a value

Functions can be defined in three ways:
  - Using the constructor of the Function object
  - By function declaration
  - By function expression
