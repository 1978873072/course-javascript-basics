To pass information to a function, you can use **parameters** (also known as **arguments**)
  - You can pass zero or several input values
  - Each parameter has Ð° name
  - Parameters are assigned to particular values when the function is called

Parameters change the function behavior depending on the passed values.

Defining and Using Function Parameters:
- Function's behavior depends on its parameters
- Parameters can be of any type
  - `Number`, `String`, `Object`, `Array`, etc.
  - Even `Function`
- Functions can have as many parameters as needed

To call a function and pass values to its parameters:
  - Use the function's name, followed by a list of expressions for each parameter
