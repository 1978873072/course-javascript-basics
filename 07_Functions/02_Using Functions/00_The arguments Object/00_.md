Every function in JavaScript has an implicit parameter `arguments`
  - It holds information about the function and all the parameters passed to the function
  - No need to be explicitly declared
    - It exists in every function

The arguments object is not an array
  - It just has some of the array functionality
  - If you need to iterate it, it's better to parse it to an array
