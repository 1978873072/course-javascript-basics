Instead of having a parameter to take in the values, the implicit parameter `arguments` is used. The `arguments` parameter automatically detects the values inside the set of parenthesis and applies statements to the given input. Since the use of `arguments` can confuse many programmers as well as cause unwanted errors, it is not a recommended method for using a function. However, if this makes sense to you and you want to use it in the future, feel free to explore this concept and expand your knowledge about it.
