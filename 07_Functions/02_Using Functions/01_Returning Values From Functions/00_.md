As mentioned previously, every function in JavaScript returns a value. If the function doesn't explicitly return a value, `undefined` is returned. The return type can be of any data type, including `Number`, `String`, `Object`, `Function`, etc. Defining a function that returns a value is quite simple. As long as the `return` keyword exists in your function, it returns a value. The `return` statement immediately terminates the function's execution and returns the specified expression to the caller. It can be used several times in a function body to return a different value depending on the situation.
