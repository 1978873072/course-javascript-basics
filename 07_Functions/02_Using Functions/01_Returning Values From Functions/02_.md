The sample code above has two functions, `multiply()` and `isEven`. The first functions takes in two numbers and returns the product of the two numbers. The second function takes in a number and returns true or false depending on whether or not the number is even. The second method has two `return` statements, and since the `return` statement exits the function when it is called, it will never return both true and false.
