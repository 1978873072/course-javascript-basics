>>Consider the following code segment:

```
function divide(number) {
  if (number % 7 == 0){
    return "divisible by 7";
  } else if (number % 5 == 0){
    return "divisible by 5";
  } else if (number % 5 == 0 && number % 7 == 0){
    return "divisible by 5 and 7";
  } else {
    return "not divisible by 5 or 7";
  }
}
```

Which of the following function call returns the output "divisible by 5 and 7"?<<

( ) `divide(5)` {{Incorrect because this function call will return "divisible by 5".}}
( ) `divide(7)` {{Incorrect because this function call will return "divisible by 7".}}
( ) `divide(35)` {{Incorrect because this function call will return "divisible by 7".}}
( ) `divide(24)` {{Incorrect because this function call will return "not divisible by 5 or 7".}}
(x) None of the above {{Correct because none of the function calls above will return "divisible by 5 and 7". In fact, no integer input can return this statement.}}

||Any number that is divisible by 5 and 7 will execute the statements in `number % 7 == 0` rather than `number % 5 == 0 && number % 7 == 0`.||
