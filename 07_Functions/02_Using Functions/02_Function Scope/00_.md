Knowing the scope of the function as well as the variables inside the function is extremely important when writing your program. Every variable has its own scope and can only be used in specific places inside the program. As mentioned previously, there are two types of scopes, the local scope and the global scope. Any variable declared inside the function, including the parameter, is considered a local variable and can only be used within the function.
