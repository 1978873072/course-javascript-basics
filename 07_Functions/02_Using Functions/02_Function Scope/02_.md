As mentioned previously, the parameter of the function is a local variable. This is why calling the three statements that are commented in the code will cause an error. The variables `sum`, `array`, and `counter` don't exist in the global level and will be hidden from the program if it is called outside the function. The function and the variable `arr` are the only two variables that are in the global scope and can be called anywhere in the program.
