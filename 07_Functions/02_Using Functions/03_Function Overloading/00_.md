JavaScript does not support function overloading, which occurs when you create two functions with the same name. Functions with the same name will hide each other so that the function cannot be called. Therefore, function overloading in JavaScript must be so called "faked". You can create functions that make it look like overloading by changing the number of parameters or the data type of the parameter.
