Software objects model real-world objects or abstract concepts
  - Examples:
    - bank, account, customer, dog, bicycle, queue

Real-world objects have **states** and **behaviors**
  - Account states:
    - holder, balance, type
  - Account behaviors:
    - withdraw, deposit, suspend

How do software objects implement real-world objects?
  - Use variables/data/properties to implement states
  - Use methods/functions to implement behaviors

An object is a software bundle of variables and related methods.

Objects:
- An **object** is a concrete **instance** of a particular object type
- Creating an object from an object type is called **instantiation**
- Objects have state
  - Set of values associated to their attributes
- Example:
  - _Type:_ Account
  - _Objects:_ Ivan's account, Peter's account
- An object is a collection of **properties**
  - An object property is association between a name and a value
    - A value of property can be either a **method** (function) or a **field** (variable)
  - Each object has **properties**
  - Properties are values attached to the object
  - Properties of an object can be accessed with a dot-notation (`.` operator) or with `[]` - indexer
- Lots of predefined objects available in JS
  - `Math`, `document`, `window`, etcâ€¦
- Objects can be created by the developer
