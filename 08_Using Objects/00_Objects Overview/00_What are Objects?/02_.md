The sample code above uses concepts we have already covered in the course previously. It access the object `Array` and then calls the property `join()` and `length` respectively. The `Array` object is pre-written in JavaScript, so accessing the properties is pretty simple. However, once you start creating your own objects that hold multiple properties, it may take you a little bit of time before you understand the concept and how to use the dot notation.
