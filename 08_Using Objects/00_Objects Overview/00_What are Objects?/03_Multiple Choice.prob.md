>>Which of the following is a valid use of the dot notation?<<

( ) `arr.length();` {{Incorrect because "length" should not have brackets.}}
( ) `arr.Filter();` {{Incorrect because `Filter()` should not be capitalized.}}
( ) `arr.Map();` {{Incorrect because `Map()` should not be capitalized.}}
(x) `arr.splice(0, 5);` {{Correct because the `splice()` method is used correctly.}}
( ) `.arrlength;` {{Incorrect because the dot should be between "arr" and "length".}}
