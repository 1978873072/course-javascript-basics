JavaScript is a **weakly typed** language
  - Variables donâ€™t have type, but their values do

JavaScript has **six** different types:
  - `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined` and `Object`

`Object` is the only reference type
  - It is passed by **reference** (every time an object's value is used, it's used through a reference)
  - When passed it's value is used somewhere, it is not copied, but instead a reference to it is passed

`Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined` are **primitive** types
  - Passed by **value** (they're copied each time their value is used)
    - New memory is allocated
    - The value is copied in the new memory
    - The value in the new memory is passed

All types derive from `Object`.
