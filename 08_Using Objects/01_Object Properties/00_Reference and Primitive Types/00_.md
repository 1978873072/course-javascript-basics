As mentioned multiple times, JavaScript is a weakly typed language. The variables don't have a type, only their values do. JavaScript has six different data types, `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined` and `Object`. Out of all these data types, only `Object` is a reference type. The rest of these data types are primitive types. Primitive types are passed by value, meaning they're copied each time their value is used. This means the original value isn't affected if it is referenced in a function. On the other hand, `Object` is passed by reference, meaning the object's value is used through a reference and will be affected by a function if it is used. Take a look at the example below for some clarification on this concept.
