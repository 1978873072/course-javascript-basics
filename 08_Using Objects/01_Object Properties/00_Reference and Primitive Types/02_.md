The first important concept to know is that all types derive from `Object`. This is why the `typeof` statement returns true when it is executed. Therefore, any data type that is not explicitly primitive is automatically a reference type. You probably noticed that the value of `num` didn't change while the value of `arr1` changed after the functions were called. The value of `num` wasn't changed as the value of `num` was passed by value and copied to the function, which is why the original value remains unchanged. On the other hand, the value of `arr1` changes because an array is an `Object`. The array is passed by referenced, not copied as a separate variable, which is the reason why the function `addArray` managed to add 1 to the start of the array. Knowing the distinction between passed by value and passed by reference is extremely important to master, so make sure you spend time on this card and fully understand the concept before moving on.
