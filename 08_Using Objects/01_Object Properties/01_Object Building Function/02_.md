The function in the code sample above creates a new object based on the parameters `first_name` and `last_name`. The object consists of three properties, one of which is a function `fullName`. The function returns an object when it is called, which is why the variables `george` and `chad` are now an object. The use of the keyword `new` is crucial as it creates a new instance of the function using the given inputs. Printing an object results in a format similar to the object itself, with the property name as well as the property value.
