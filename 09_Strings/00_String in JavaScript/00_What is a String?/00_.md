Strings are something you have already been working with throughout the whole course, starting from the Hello World program. A string is a sequence of characters that can be enclosed in single or double quotes. String is a primitive data type, meaning it is copied and passed by value. String are also immutable, meaning every time a string is changed, a new string is created instead of changing the old string.
