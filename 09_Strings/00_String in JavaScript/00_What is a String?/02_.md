The code sample above show an example of two strings, one that is enclosed by double quotes and the other enclosed by single quotes. String variable declared in the global scope can be accessed anywhere else in the program without a double quote, like how `str`  is used within the `console.log()` message. We will be working with string methods in the upcoming content, so make sure you understand each concept as you move through the chapter.
