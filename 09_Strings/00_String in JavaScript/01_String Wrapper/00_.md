As string is a primitive type, it has an object wrapper type.

Primitive types keep only their value
  - When a property is called, the JS engine converts the primitive into its corresponding object type and calls the property

Since primitive type wrappers are of type object, properties can be attached to them.

From Object to Primitive Type
  - `new String('â€¦')` - creates a string object
  - `String(strObject)` - creates a primitive string
