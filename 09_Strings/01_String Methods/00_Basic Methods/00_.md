Below are some basic methods that can be used with strings. The `.length` property as well as the indexer and the `charAt()` methods are all string properties/methods that you will be using in the future. The syntax of the following properties and methods are shown below.

`string.length`
  - returns the number of characters in the string
  
Indexer (`string[index]`)
  - gets a single-character string at location the index
  - index starts from 0
  - if `index` is outside the range of string characters, the indexer returns `undefined`

`charAt(index)`
  - gets a single-character string at location index
  - works similarly to the indexer
