The three properties and methods are shown in the sample code above. The property `str.length` returns the length of the string, which is 12. Note that the space bar as well as the exclamation mark count towards the total length of the string. The indexer returns the character at the specified index, which is why 'H' is printed. The `charAt()` method does the exact same thing and prints the character at index 0. If the index used in the indexer or in the `charAt()` method is not an appropriate index in the string, executing it will return `undefined`.
