>>Consider the following statement:

```
var str = "Hello World!";
```

What is the length and the last index of the string `str`?<<

( ) Length: 11, Last Index: 10 {{Incorrect because the whitespace and the exclamation mark counts towards the length of the string.}}
( ) Length: 11, Last Index: 11 {{Incorrect because the whitespace and the exclamation mark counts towards the length of the string.}}
(x) Length: 12, Last Index: 11 {{Correct because the last index of a string is always the length minus 1.}}
( ) Length: 12, Last Index: 12 {{Incorrect because the last index of a string is always the length minus 1.}}
( ) Length: 13, Last Index: 12 {{Incorrect because the string has a length of 12 (10 letters, one whitespace, one symbol).}}

||The whitespace and the exclamation mark both counts towards the length of the string.||
