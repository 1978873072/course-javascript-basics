There are many methods that can be utilized when searching a string. Each method has different use case and most of them have different parameters. The methods are `replace()`, `search()`, `indexOf()`, and `lastIndexOf()`. The syntax and the functions of the methods are shown below.

`string.replace(str1, str2)`
  - replaces first occurrence of `str1` with `str2`

`string.search(regex)`
  - searches for a substring based on regular expression (you will learn about this later)

`string.indexOf(substring,position)`
  - returns the left-most occurrence of `substring` in a string after the index `position`
  - position is optional and has default value of `0`
  - if string doesn't contain `substring`, returns `-1`

`string.lastIndexOf(substring,position)`
  - returns the right-most occurrence of `substring` in a string before the index `position`
  - position is optional, the default value is `string.length`
  - if string doesn't contain `substring`, returns `-1`
