Let's take a look at these methods one by one. The `replace()` method replaces the first occurrence of 'A' with 'Z'. This is why the new string starts with 'Z' instead of 'A'. The `search()` method searches for the first occurrence of 'A' using regular expression and prints the index, which is why 0 is printed to the console. The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of 'B' starting from the left, which is why 1 is printed to the console. The `lastIndexOf` method return the index of the last occurrence of 'B', which is why 21 is printed to the console.
