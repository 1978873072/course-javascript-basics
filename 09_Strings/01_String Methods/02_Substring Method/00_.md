The substring methods returns a certain section of the original string based on the parameters in the function. There are two methods for substring, `substr()` and `substring()`. The syntax and the function of each method is shown below.

`string.substr(start, length)`
  - returns a substring, starting from index `start` for `length` characters
  - `length` is optional

`string.substring(start, end)`
  - returns a substring, starting from `start` and ending at `end`
  - `end` is optional if `end` is equal to the length of the string
