The code sample above shows the use of both `substr()` and `substring()`. The `substr()` method creates a new string that consists of 5 characters starting from index 0 of the original string. Therefore, only "Hello" is printed on the first line. The `substring()` method creates a new string starting from the 6th index all the way to the last index of the string, 12. This prints "World!" on the console. As mentioned previously, the `end` parameter of the `substring()` method is not necessary if `end` is equal to the length of the string. Try removing the "12" from the method and see if the output is the same.
