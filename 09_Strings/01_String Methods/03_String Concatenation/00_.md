String is an immutable type
  - A value cannot be changed
  - Instead a new string is created

There are a few ways to concatenate strings
  - Using '+' operator
  - Using concat() method

String concatenation is one of the most used operations with strings
  - Yet it is hard to optimize it
  - Concatenating strings is a slow operation
    - Each concatenation allocates new memory
  - Each browser makes optimizations of its own
  - Old browsers concatenate very slow with `+`
