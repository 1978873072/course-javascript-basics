String is an immutable type, meaning the value cannot be changed. Therefore, each time you change the value of a string, a new string is created. Concatenating a string can be achieved using the '+' operator or the `concat()` method. String concatenation is one of the most used operations with strings, but overusing it will overflow the memory as each concatenation allocates new memory.
