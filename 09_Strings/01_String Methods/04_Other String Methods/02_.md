Let's take a look at the methods one by one. The `valueOf()` method returns the primitive value of the string, which is essentially the same thing saying `console.log(str1)`. The `split()` method separates each word in `str2` by detecting the space bar and places each word into an element in the array. The `trim()`, `trimLeft()`, and `trimRight()` methods simply remove the white spaces in the string and make it look cleaner when printed.
