Regular expressions is an extremely powerful tool implemented in most programming languages. Regular expressions have their own syntax and the use of special characters that are often hard to remember unless they are used frequently. Regular expression can be tested online on sites such as http://www.regexr.com/ or https://regex101.com/. In JavaScript, regular expression are built-in and can be created using regex literals or a function constructor. Regex literals are useful for static expressions while function constructors are useful when the expression depends on other parameters.
