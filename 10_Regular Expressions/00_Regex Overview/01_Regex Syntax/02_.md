The code sample above shows an example of a regex literal. The constant `literalRegex` is used to represent a regex expression that matches any string that ends with the letter 'y'. Therefore, the first `console.log()` statement prints the last index of the string while the second statement prints -1 (meaning it does not exist). The second example of a regex is shown using a function constructor. The function constructor uses the keyword `new` to create a regular expression. The new regex matches any string that starts with the letter 'T'. The two `console.log()` statements that follow simply check if this condition is met and returns the index of the string (or -1).
