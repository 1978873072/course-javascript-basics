There are two regex methods that are important to know and are extremely useful when working with regular expressions. The first method is `RegExp.test()`, which searches for a match in a given string and returns either true or false. The second method is `RegExp.exec()`. This method searches for the match in a given string and returns an array if the regex is found. If the given regex is not found, the method will return null. Take a look at the sample code below to see how the `test()` and `exec()` method are used.
