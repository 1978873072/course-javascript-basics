The code above shows two different examples of each method. The first method, `test()` returns true or false based on whether or not the condition of the regular expression is found in the string. The second method `exec()` returns an array as shown in the console containing details about the character, index, and the input of the function. The last `console.log()` statement will return null as the word "Hymn" does not end with the character 'y'.
