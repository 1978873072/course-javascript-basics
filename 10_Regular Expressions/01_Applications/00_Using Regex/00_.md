In JavaScript, regular expressions are used mostly when you need a search and replace function for long lines of text. Regular expression can be used to save time and to search for specific strings and characters without complicating you code with a bunch of functions and string methods. As mentioned previously, regular expression can also be used to validate user input and make sure the user inputted the information correctly.
