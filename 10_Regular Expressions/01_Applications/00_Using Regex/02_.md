The sample code above removes all white spaces and new lines using regex and replaces them with a single space. As you can see the original string within `text` is extremely messy, with multiple irregular spaces and unnecessary new lines. However, after using the `replace()` function (part of the String Object), the string is completely different and looks like a proper sentence with one space between each word. Without using regular expressions, trying to accomplish a task like this requires `for` loops and multiple lines of code.
