  - `[xyz]` – Character set - Matches any of the characters
  - `[x-z]` – Character set - Matches any characters between the characters range
  - `[^xyz]` – Inverted characters set - Matches all other characters
  - `{N}` – matches exactly `N` occurrences of the preceding character/group
  - `{N, M}` – matches at least `N` and at most `M` occurrences of the preceding character/group
  - `^` - matches the start of the string
  - `$` - matches the end of the string
