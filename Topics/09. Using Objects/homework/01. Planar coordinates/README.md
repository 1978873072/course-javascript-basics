# Planar coordinates

## Description
Write functions for working with shapes in standard Planar coordinate system.
  - **Points** are represented by coordinates
  - **Lines** are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending
You will be given three line segments. Calculate their length.
Check if the line segments can form a triangle.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing **twelve values**
  - Line 1, Point 1 X
  - Line 1, Point 1 Y
  - Line 1, Point 2 X
  - Line 1, Point 2 Y
  - Line 2, Point 1 X
  - ...

## Output
- The output should be consisted of four lines
  - Three lines showing the length of each line segment
  - Fourth line should be one of:
    - `Triangle can be formed`
	- `Triangle can't be formed`

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
